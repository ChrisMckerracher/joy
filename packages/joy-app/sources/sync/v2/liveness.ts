// v2 session liveness → the store's `activeAt` heartbeat.
//
// Everything downstream (presence resolver, sidebar grouping, useSessionStatus)
// asks ONE question: "have we heard from this session within
// SESSION_STALE_AFTER_MS?" — answered from `activeAt`. Previously the daemon's
// 30s keepalive kept that timestamp moving; under v2 the relay only bumps a
// row's timestamps on TURN events, so an idle-but-alive session went "stale"
// 90s after its last turn and fell out of the active group (or vanished).
//
// The relay's `online` flag IS the heartbeat: it means the owning daemon holds
// an unexpired lease (20s TTL, renewed continuously), and the app re-polls the
// list every 2.5s. So while online, activeAt is "now"; once the lease lapses it
// falls back to the last moment we actually saw it live — which doubles as an
// honest "last seen" — never earlier than the row's own last turn.

/** The states in which a session still has a process behind it. The rest —
 *  detached, failed, archived — are over, whatever their machine is doing. */

 * Is this session live right now? The lease is the MACHINE's pulse; a session
 * inherits it only while it is in a live state. The relay applies the same
 * rule since 2026-09-18, and this guards against one that does not yet: every
 * archived run on a running daemon used to read online, so the sidebar said
 * "last seen just now" on all of them, forever.
